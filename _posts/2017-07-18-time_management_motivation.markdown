The remote/part-time feature of this program is, well, pretty great. But, it does also require a little extra focus on time management and finding the motivation to keep working through that last. final. failed. test. that you've been struggling with for the past 30 minutes.

I haven't been working on this course for more than a few days, but I'm going to start putting some of my own methods / ideas for the future that will (hopefully) help keep me motivated as these lessons get harder and harder (eek).

#### 1. Learn.co chat!
#### 2. Exercise breaks

#### 3. Snack breaks
#### 4. No Netflix breaks!
#### 5. Dumb things, like remembering to take my glasses home from work....doh
#### 6. My BFF Google
#### 7. Study Groups
#### 8. One more time...my BFF Google


### 9. Talking to myself

I'm going to elaborate on this one. If I've been spending a little too much time staring at my computer and I find myself fighting off the urge to scan Instagram oooone more time, I read the lessons aloud. It not only helps me focus, but it often helps me remember things a little bit better, too.
