In this post I'm going to talk about some tests I've added to an existing Ruby on Rails project (knowing that it is a much better idea to build your project with tests rather than adding them after). But hey, I need the practice!

Learning about the TDD (test-driven development) philosophy has been really fascinating. When I was at Flatiron School, I remember thinking that I should add tests to my projects as I worked, but as someone with a full-time job working on the program in the morning, at night, and on weekends, I was worried about taking extra time to work on tests when they were not a requirement in the program. Looking back, I regret not taking that time to start diving into tests in Rails, and later React, but alas! Life goes on, and here I am trying to make up for lost time.
