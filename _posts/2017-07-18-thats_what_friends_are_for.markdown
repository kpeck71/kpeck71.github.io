After stumbling in to a marketing/communications job at a small web design/development firm during grad school, I met some designers and developers. I sat in the Sales/Marketing office but I really loved working on the company's own content management system and seeing how the dev team worked with our clients and thought through the challenges they were faced with each day. I stuck with marketing for a few more years, but was always pulled towards any opportunities to work with HTML and CSS, though it was always at a basic to intermediate level.

In 2016, a friend casually asked what my dream job would be and without really thinking, I replied: "I want to be a web developer." She didn't really know what I was talking about, but after explaining what it was and how you can potentially get a job in the field, she was very excited at the idea of me following this dream.

That was the final kick in the pants I needed to look in to online web development courses and, eventually, a part-time General Assembly class in front-end web development. From there, I kept up with other online courses but on an on-and-off basis. Then, I found the Women Take Tech Scholarship and decided to apply. After a few false starts and telling myself that I'd never get it, I took the leap and applied.

*Note: My aforementioned friend is, unfortunately, not Beyonce.*

Now I've started the Full Stack Web Development track and I could not be happier. With a little gentle nudging from friends, some internal motivational pep talks, and the Women Take Tech Scholarship, I am SO ready to take this next, huge step foward towards my goal.
