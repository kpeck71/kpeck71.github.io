I wish I was further along in the curriculum and had more technical talk to go through, but I've reached OO Ruby (woohoo!) and am struggling a bit through Classes and Objects. I think much of it will get better with practice (and possibly a re-read of a *Well-Grounded Rubyist* chapter), but I'm definitely adding way too many attraccessors that I don't need, and then not completely understanding why I didn't need them.

Pry has been helpful, but I often have trouble understanding the relationships between classes and objects and how they interact, like how to pass around variables and instances and constants. When does this method need an argument? When does it not? Is it an instance method or an instance variable? Blerg. Time for more practice!

I am really enjoying the idea of making a program more flexible by making attributes equal to an instance of a class instead of equating them to simply a string. (Even if it does make things slightly more confusing!)


**Metaphor/Analogy vs Application**
I'm also discovering that some concepts become super-clear with an analogy or metaphor, while others really only make sense when I see how that concept would be applied.

One example? Private methods. The *Well-Grounded Rubyist* uses a Baker example to explain Private Methods, while a Learn lesson used a Bartender example. Perhaps I'm just too familiar with real-world bartenders, but the examples of what private methods belonged to the bartender just completely threw me off. Then, in my wellness check-in with Tracy Holmes (which was great for SO many reasons), Tracy explained how you might use a private method, and that simple explanation just made so much more sense to me.

So ends another blog ramble. 

**Goals:**
<ul>
<li> Watch more videos outside of those that we are shown in the lessons</li>
<li> Practice more! (Codewars?)</li>
<li> Get to a Flatiron School meetup in NYC </li>
<li> Finish more than 20 lessons each week.</li>
<li> Actually ask questions in a Study Group instead of just lurking. </li>
</ul>
