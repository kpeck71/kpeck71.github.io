I feel like I should be farther along in this course so I have more technical topics to write about on this blog, but I'm coming up a little short. But, I'm almost done with the Object Oriented Ruby section! 

I am going to be attending my first Study Group tomorrow after work. I had hoped to attend an On-Campus Beginner Study Session tonight but I got stuck at work and could not make it. I also signed up for a Women's Only Session on Monday, so I'm looking forward to that. I know that things will soon be getting tougher in this course, and it will be extremely helpful to, well...have help. 

I hadn't joined any Study Groups because they usually seem to be on topics that I am not working on, but it will be good to see how people work out solutions, understand the types of questions they ask, and just get a general idea about how to tackle coding projects. I think one of the big little-things that I've learned, and this is something that I've been told countless times before but just had to do myself, is that I should write out some pseudo code before diving in to the real code. Far too often I skip that step because I think I know what I'm doing - HA! - and instead I get frustrated more quickly and end up struggling. I haven't bought a rubber duck yet, but I think my stuffed wombat should do the trick. Accents may be involved. 

I came across this issue in a recent lab (key_min_value I think?) where I merely had to set two values to nil in the beginning so I could use them later. Instead, I was trying to retrieve those values in all sorts of ways when I should have kept it simple and thought about everything I needed to make this lab work, rather than figuring out how I was going to get to those things right away. 

Ok, back to my Nested Arrays. And soon, back to my Prime Number lab that I have such a GIGANTIC mental block on. Blerg.
