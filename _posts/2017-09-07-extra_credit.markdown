Working full-time and managing this part-time remote program has been an OK experience so far. I'm still at the early stages of the program, and with my previous experience with other courses (online and in-person), I feel comfortable with where I'm at, even though I am slightly behind on my schedule due to some summer vacationing sans laptop. 

Knowing that, I'm still searching for some other outside resources (or even in Learn!) to expand my knowledge while still prioritizing Learn.co, conquering this September #BackToCode challenge, and not getting too overwhelmed or distracted. Do I practice responsive design? Do I refresh myself on Javascript again? Do I take out some books on Ruby for a little bit of a break from Learn.co while staying in the same world. Tracy Holmes gave me SO many great resources during our Skype chat so that is a fantastic start, plus I've been picking up good tips from stalking the Slack channels, but I'm also adding some other ideas/thoughts below.

Side note. This explanation in Stack Overflow (linked to from a lesson) helped me understand (or at least start to understand) the case equality operator (aka threequal) versus comparative operator.
